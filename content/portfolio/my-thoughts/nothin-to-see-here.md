For the past couple of months, I've been thinking about the tech writer's role within an organization, whether in a massive corporate environment, a small startup, SaaS, industrial, agricultural, you name it. Do we serve a meaningful purpose in a company? And, why do they need us?

I've been working on a project with a team outside my time-zone. That means no meetings, no context, no quick Slack messages to ask a question. It also means countless hours reading through Jira tickets to figure out what the project is about. I have to work on documentation for a new feature, but through my Jira investigation, I can see the discussions, ideas, designs, user data, the whole lifecycle from brainstorming to end product. It gives me a good grasp of the problems we're trying to solve. And in the end? I make sure the customer gets a nicely packaged version of our "vision".
