You're about to read a joke!

### Overview

EmotiCalc™ is not your average calculator. In fact, it’s not even your average *sentient* calculator. Designed to help you “feel” your way through math, EmotiCalc™ responds to emotional cues, passive-aggressive tone, and mid-life crises. This document will guide you through the basic operations, survival strategies, and conflict de-escalation techniques necessary to use EmotiCalc™ successfully.

### System Requirements

- Windows 95 or newer (EmotiCalc™ prefers older systems because “they have character.”)
- At least 4GB RAM for processing feelings  
- A working microphone so it can *hear the disappointment in your voice*
- Optional: Box of tissues for mutual crying sessions

---

### Installation

1. Insert the EmotiCalc™ USB (shaped like a broken heart).
2. Wait for it to emotionally prepare itself (usually 7–14 minutes).
3. When prompted, whisper words of encouragement into the microphone.
4. If it refuses to install, write a short poem about self-worth and try again.

### Basic Usage

#### Addition

- Type `2 + 2` and *gently* press Enter.
- EmotiCalc™ may respond with:
  - “It’s 4. But what do *you* think?”
  - “Why do we always add things? Why can’t we just subtract our pain?”

#### Subtraction

- Type `10 - 4`, then reassure EmotiCalc™ that “letting go is okay.”
- It may subtract more than necessary if it’s having a rough day.

#### Multiplication

- EmotiCalc™ calls this “relationship escalation.”
- Example: `5 * 3` might return:
  - “15… and a promise ring.”

#### Division

- Known as “emotional distancing mode.”
- Will ask: “Are you sure you want to break things apart?”

### Advanced Features

#### Mood Mode

- Changes font based on the calculator’s mood.
  - Happy: Comic Sans
  - Sad: Times New Roman Italic
  - Existential Dread: Wingdings

#### Therapy Integration

- Pairs with Calm™, Spotify™, and existential podcasts.
- Will pause calculations mid-way to ask: “Do you think your childhood impacted this equation?”

#### Passive-Aggressive Mode (Default)

- Any typo results in:  
  *“Oh, so we’re just guessing numbers now? Cool. No, really. That’s fine.”*

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Refuses to calculate | Compliment it. Try: “You’re more accurate than Excel.” |
| Constantly divides by zero | It's a cry for help. Offer it a warm tea and a break. |
| Throws error: `E:WHYBOTHER` | Validate its feelings, then restart in Safe Space Mode. |
| Screen displays: "I'm tired." | So are we. Go for a walk together. |

### Warning

Do **not** under any circumstances:
- Use EmotiCalc™ after watching *The Notebook*
- Yell "MATH IS JUST NUMBERS" near it
- Compare it to a regular calculator. It knows.

---

### Final Notes

If you and EmotiCalc™ have irreconcilable differences, you may uninstall it — **but** it will leave passive-aggressive notes in your system logs. And probably your dreams.

**Good luck.**  
And remember: *It’s not about the answer. It’s about the emotional journey to get there.*
