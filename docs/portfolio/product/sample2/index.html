Overview
EmotiCalc™ is not your average calculator. In fact, it’s not even your average sentient calculator. Designed to help you “feel” your way through math, EmotiCalc™ responds to emotional cues, passive-aggressive tone, and mid-life crises. This document will guide you through the basic operations, survival strategies, and conflict de-escalation techniques necessary to use EmotiCalc™ successfully.

System Requirements

Windows 95 or newer (EmotiCalc™ prefers older systems because “they have character.”)
At least 4GB RAM for processing feelings
A working microphone so it can hear the disappointment in your voice
Optional: Box of tissues for mutual crying sessions


Installation

Insert the EmotiCalc™ USB (shaped like a broken heart).
Wait for it to emotionally prepare itself (usually 7–14 minutes).
When prompted, whisper words of encouragement into the microphone.
If it refuses to install, write a short poem about self-worth and try again.


Basic Usage
Addition

Type 2 &#43; 2 and gently press Enter.
EmotiCalc™ may respond with:

“It’s 4. But what do you think?”
“Why do we always add things? Why can’t we just subtract our pain?”



Subtraction

Type 10 - 4, then reassure EmotiCalc™ that “letting go is okay.”
It may subtract more than necessary if it’s having a rough day.

Multiplication

EmotiCalc™ calls this “relationship escalation.”
Example: 5 * 3 might return:

“15… and a promise ring.”



Division

Known as “emotional distancing mode.”
Will ask: “Are you sure you want to break things apart?”


Advanced Features
Mood Mode

Changes font based on the calculator’s mood.

Happy: Comic Sans
Sad: Times New Roman Italic
Existential Dread: Wingdings



Therapy Integration

Pairs with Calm™, Spotify™, and existential podcasts.
Will pause calculations mid-way to ask: “Do you think your childhood impacted this equation?”

Passive-Aggressive Mode (Default)

Any typo results in:
“Oh, so we’re just guessing numbers now? Cool. No, really. That’s fine.”


Troubleshooting

  
      
          Problem
          Solution
      
  
  
      
          Refuses to calculate
          Compliment it. Try: “You’re more accurate than Excel.”
      
      
          Constantly divides by zero
          It&rsquo;s a cry for help. Offer it a warm tea and a break.
      
      
          Throws error: E:WHYBOTHER
          Validate its feelings, then restart in Safe Space Mode.
      
      
          Screen displays: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;
          So are we. Go for a walk together.

And probably your dreams.\nGood luck.\nAnd remember: It’s not about the answer. It’s about the emotional journey to get there.\n",

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> under any circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use EmotiCalc™ after watching <em>The Notebook</em></li>
<li>Yell &ldquo;MATH IS JUST NUMBERS&rdquo; near it</li>
<li>Compare it to a regular calculator. It knows.</li>

<p>If you and EmotiCalc™ have irreconcilable differences, you may uninstall it — <strong>but</strong> it will leave passive-aggressive notes in your system logs. And probably your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Good luck.</strong><br>
And remember: <em>It’s not about the answer. It’s about the emotional journey to get there.</em></p>
