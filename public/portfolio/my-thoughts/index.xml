      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the tech writer&amp;rsquo;s role within an organization, whether in a massive corporate environment, a small startup, SaaS, industrial, agricultural, you name it. Do we serve a meaningful purpose in a company? And, why do they need us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project with a team outside my time-zone. That means no meetings, no context, no quick Slack messages to ask a question. It also means countless hours reading through Jira tickets to figure out what the project is about. I have to work on documentation for a new feature, but through my Jira investigation, I can see the discussions, ideas, designs, user data, the whole lifecycle from brainstorming to end product. It gives me a good grasp of the problems we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve. And in the end? I make sure the customer gets a nicely packaged version of our &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
